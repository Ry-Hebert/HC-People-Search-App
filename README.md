## Project Specs:

The People Search Application  
 
* Business Requirements
  * The application accepts search input in a text box and then displays in a pleasing style a list of people where any part of their first or last name matches what was typed in the search box (displaying at least name, address, age, interests, and a picture).
  * Solution should either seed data or provide a way to enter new users or both.
  * Simulate search being slow and have the UI gracefully handle the delay.  
* Technical Requirements
  * A Web Application using WebAPI and a front-end JavaScript framework (e.g., Angular, React, etc.)
  *  Use an ORM framework to talk to the database
  *  Unit Tests for appropriate parts of the application
